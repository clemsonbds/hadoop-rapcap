# Hadoop RAPCAP Library

A Hadoop library for FileInputFormats that use RAPCAP, an algorithm for reliably detecting record boundaries in non-delimited variable length record storage formats.  Certain file formats such as PCAP are unsplittable without record detection, and therefore must be read by a single Map task.  This library addresses that problem.

RAPCAP
------

Sequential record storage formats such as the network trace storage format Packet CAPture (PCAP) are designed to be read sequentially - they consist of a records appended to the file tail without using indices or delimiters.  Each record contains a pointer to the start of the next record.  As such, they are considered "unsplittable" - it is difficult to determine a record start position from an arbitrary access point.
RAPCAP is an algorithm for reliably finding the start of a record by building an initial set of candidate positions and refining the solution space to a single outcome.  The algorithm and analysis were published in the proceedings of the 2nd IFIP/IEEE International Workshop on Analytics for Network and Service Management, and is available at:
